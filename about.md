Jane is an accomplished Professional Holistic Practitioner and has been trained in the healing arts since 2003. She utilizes a variety of energy medicine treatment modalities in her practice including Chinese Acupuncture, MOXA, cupping, TuiNa, Reflexology, Bio-energetics and Life Coaching.

Jane has a passion for people, and for learning and promoting wellness. She believes that the rampant and pervasive amount of stress in todayâ€™s world caused by work and environmental factors causes the body to become out of balance. As such, Jane approaches each patient from a holistic lifestyle perspective.
