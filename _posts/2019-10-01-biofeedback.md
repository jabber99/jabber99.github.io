## What is Biofeedback?

Bioenergetic Intolerance Elimination is a simple, natural new approach that 
enables one’s body to recognize sensitivities or intolerances, assisting in 
recovery from associated allergy-like symptoms, without the use of needles or 
drugs.

## How does Biofeedback work?

A lightweight state-of-the-art device is used to transmit a low electronic 
frequency directly onto various acupuncture points (without the use of needles)
on the body to stimulate and clear any blockages in energy known as stressors.

During this procedure, the client is exposed to the frequencies of the 
substances they are intolerant or sensitive to (not the actual substances 
themselves). While the blockages are clearing, the body’s cells can adapt to 
recognize the stressing frequency. When this non-invasive and painless 
procedure is complete, the body will hopefully no longer see the sensitivity 
or intolerance as a threat when exposed to it, therefore no longer producing 
any adverse reactions.
